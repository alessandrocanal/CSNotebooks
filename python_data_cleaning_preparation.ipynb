inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or outliers in the data.\n","* **Converting Data Types**: Ensuring that each variable is stored in the correct data type (e.g., converting strings to numbers, or objects to datetime objects).\n","* **Standardizing and Normalizing**: Scaling numerical features to a standard range or distribution, which is often important for machine learning algorithms.\n","* **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance or gain new insights.\n","\n","Effective data preparation ensures that subsequent analysis yields accurate,
